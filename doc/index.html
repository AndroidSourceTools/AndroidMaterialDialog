                 <h4>About</h4>

                 <p>"AndroidMaterialDialog" is an Android-library, which provides a builder, which allows to create dialogs, which are designed according to Android 5's Material Design guidelines even on pre-Lollipop devices. The following screenshots show the appearance of a dialog, which has been created by using the library:</p>

                 <p><center><a href="images/example1.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/example1.png" width="800" alt="Example"></a></center></p>
                 
                 <p><center><a href="images/example2.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/example2.png" width="800" alt="Example"></a></center></p>

                 <p>The aim of this documentation is to offer an overview of the project's source code and to explain, how the interface, which is provided by the library, can be used and how the underlying implementations are supposed to work.</p>            

                <p>The library provides the following features:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The builder has been designed to be similar to the Android SDK's built-in class  <tt>android.app.AlertDialog.Builder</tt> and therefore provides all of its functionalities, including the possibilities to create dialogs with a title, icon, message, up to three buttons and optional list items.</li>
                    <li>The library uses the AppCompat v7 support library in order to retrieve the color of a dialog's title and button texts from the applied theme. Alternatively, these colors can be set manually using the builder.</li>
                    <li>A dialog's title message and content can be replaced by any custom view.</li>
                    <li>The builder supports to create dialogs, whose buttons are stacked, as introduced in the Material Design guidelines.</li>
                    <li>All dialogs can contain a header, which shows a background image or color as well as an optional icon.</li>
                    <li>The library provides additional builders, which allow to create progress dialogs or a dialog, which allows to switch between multiple fragments.</li>
                </ul>
